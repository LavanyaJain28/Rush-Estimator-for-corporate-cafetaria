People of corporate offices visit cafeteria on daily basis. Due to daily rush , there are chances of shortage of food.Due to this, profit of the cafeteria gets affected. So to resolve this issue, we can make a system which can count of current people sitting in cafeteria , entering and leaving. With the help of this data, it would be convenient for the staff of cafeteria and food will be prepared accordingly. With the help of this study, we can estimate restaurant wait times.
Nowadays customer satisfaction is the main priority.
"Those that continue with seating from a first-come, first-served waitlist should consider ways to empower guests", forexample, by giving accurate wait times or issuing pagers. To address this issue, we implement a simulation model that estimates a customer's wait time more precisely.
